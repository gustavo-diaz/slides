# Research Agenda

## Bias-variance tradeoff as darts

![](list/darts.png){fig-align="center"}

## But the game of darts is more complicated

## Two types of tradeoffs

::: incremental

1. **Explicit:** Is a little bias worth the increase in precision?

2. **Implicit:** Improve precision without sacrificing unbiasedness?

# List Experiments

## List experiment

Here is a list of things that some people have done.

## List experiment {visibility="uncounted"}

Please listen to them and then tell me HOW MANY of them you have done in the past two years.

## List experiment {visibility="uncounted"}

Do not tell me which ones. Just tell me HOW MANY:

### Control group

1. Discussed politics with family or friends
2. Cast a ballot for governor Phil Bryant
3. Paid dues to a union
4. Given money to a Tea Party candidate

### Treatment group

1. Discussed politics with family or friends
2. Cast a ballot for governor Phil Bryant
3. Paid dues to a union
4. Given money to a Tea Party candidate
5. **Voted "YES" on the Personhood Initiative**


## Prevalence rate

$$
\text{Proportion(Voted yes)} =\\ \text{Mean(List with sensitive item)} -\\ \text{Mean(List without sensitive item)}
$$

. . .

- We get a **prevalence rate estimate**

. . .

- But we **do not know** how individual respondents voted!

## Compare with direct question

Did you vote YES or NO on the Personhood Initiative, which appeared on the November 2011 Mississippi General Election Ballot?

. . .


$$
\text{Proportion(Voted yes)} =\\ \text{Mean(Voted yes)}
$$


## Validation

```{r}
# got this through
# https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/
# And by reverse engineering table 1
# Because replication data was not available
# So this has some human error
validation = data.frame(
  technique = c("Direct question", "List experiment"),
  estimate = c(0.396, 0.487),
  upper = c(0.419, 0.562),
  lower = c(0.376, 0.417)
)

actual_vote = 0.65

ggplot(validation) +
  aes(x = technique, y = estimate) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0) + 
  geom_linerange(aes(x = technique, ymin = lower, ymax = upper),
                 linewidth = 1, alpha = 0) +
  ylim(0.2, 0.8) +
  labs(x = "Technique", 
       y = "Estimated proportion of 'No' votes")

## Double list experiment {.smaller}

**List A**

- Californians for Disability (advocating for people with disabilities)
- California National Organization for Women (advocating for women's equality and empowerment)
- American Family Association (advocating for pro-family values)
- American Red Cross (humanitarian organization)

**List B**

- American Legion (veterans service organization)
- Equality California (gay and lesbian advocacy organization)
- Tea Party Patriots (conservative group supporting lower taxes and limited government)
- Salvation Army (charitable organization)

## Sensitive item

**Organization X (advocating for immigration reduction and measures against undocumented immigration)**

::: incremental
- Randomly appears in list A or B

- **Single list:** Half of the respondents see sensitive item

- **Double list:** Everyone sees it

- Equivalent to making two parallel list experiments

:::

## Three prevalence estimators

$$
\text{Proportion(Support)}_A = \text{Mean}(A_t) - \text{Mean}(A_c)
$$

. . .

$$
\text{Proportion(Support)}_B = \text{Mean}(B_t) - \text{Mean}(B_c)
$$

. . .


$$
\text{Proportion(Support)}_{Pooled} = [\text{Proportion(Support)}_A + \text{Proportion(Support)}_B)]/2
$$ 

## DLE yields more precise estimates
