## Why does monitoring improve performance?

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
**1. Top-down enforcement**

::: incremental
- Monitoring alone reduces inefficiency
- Ex-post sanctions, legal investigations
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**2. Bottom-up accountability**

::: incremental
- Information helps voters hold politicians accountable
- Those found underperforming are voted out of office

## Bottom-up accountability?

## Lack of sanctions does not imply lack of accountability

. . .

{{< fa arrow-right >}} Politicians learn about monitoring efforts before they occur and adjust behavior accordingly

## Argument: 
### Incumbents anticipate bottom-up accountability

::: incremental
- Politicians selected for auditing expect increased scrutiny on their performance
- This is true even if monitoring does not uncover irregularities
- News of monitoring alone attracts voter attention to performance in office
- Those seeking reelection have incentives to take action before news are public

## Why spending?

I will make my pretty triangles here

## Why *reducing* spending?

More triangles!

## Data: Anti-corruption audits in Brazil

::: columns

:::incremental

- *Controladoria Geral da Uni√£o (CGU)*

- 2003-2015

- Lottery selects municipalities to audit use of federal funds

- Make results public

- 40 lotteries, 2,187 audits

## Distribution of audits over time

Here maybe redo figure for slide transitions

## Research design

::: incremental
- Mayoral elections in 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016
- **Treatment:** Municipality selected for auditing (binary)
- **Outcome:** Spending per capita (logged)

    
&nbsp;

- **QOI:** Average treatment effect of audit selection on spending outcomes
- Distinguish between **reelection-eligible vs. term-limited**
:::

## Results: Election-year outcomes

Here redo figure

## Results: Audit timing

Here redo figure

## Also in the paper

Here summarize other findings

## Conclusion

- Mayors decrease spending in reaction to audit selection

- More pronounced under reelection incentives

. . .

### Implications

- Bottom-up accountability still matters
- Politicians learn to navigate monitoring efforts over time
- Long-term monitoring still helpful
- But at the expense of improving service provision?
