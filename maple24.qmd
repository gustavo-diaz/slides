## Limitations

. . .

"Future research should confirm if our findings generalize..."

::: incremental
- ...with a representative sample
- ...in other countries
- ...beyond the survey setting
- ...when using behavioral outcomes
:::

## Usual workflow

::: incremental
1. Research idea

2. Realize resource/ethical/practical limitations

3. Conduct experiment with limitations

4. Wave hands about external validity

<!-- One example about doing more with data -->
<!-- Another about showing when external invalidity matters or not -->

## Goal

::: incremental
- Should we ever implement an externally invalid survey experiment **on purpose**?

- Identify what makes external invalidity *desirable*

- **Challenge:** Different kinds of external (in)validity

## External validity concerns

<!-- Merge Campbell, Shadish, Cook (see Jiawei Fu paper) and Egami and Hartman  -->

<!-- Present XTYC as a table -->

```{r}
concerns = tribble(
  ~Type, ~Concern,
  "Samples", "Does this apply to a different population?",
  "Treatments", "Do they resemble real-world phenomena?",
  "Outcomes", "Do they reflect actual behaviors?",
  "Contexts", "Does this apply in a different setting?"
)

kbl(concerns) %>% 
  column_spec(2, italic = TRUE) %>% 
    row_spec(1:4, color = "white")
```

## Treatments
<!-- Weird experiments can approximate behavioral benchmarks better -->

## Outcomes

## Contexts

## Contexts

*Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were selected for their theoretical case value;*

## Contexts

*Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were selected for their theoretical case value; both are high in gender inegalitarianism, and they offer tough tests.*

## Contexts

*Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were selected for their theoretical case value; both are high in gender inegalitarianism, and they offer tough tests. In addition, while these neighboring countries have much in common, both resource-rich and highly conservative, they also differ in important ways.*

## Contexts

*Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were selected for their theoretical case value; both are high in gender inegalitarianism, and they offer tough tests. In addition, while these neighboring countries have much in common, both resource-rich and highly conservative, they also differ in important ways. Thus, if similar results are found, the case for generalizability across different interaction types and varying national circumstances will be strengthened.*

## Conclusion
<!-- Show table with each type of invalidity is good for -->

```{r}
merits = tribble(
  ~Invalid, ~Benefit,
  "Samples", "Delineate existing generalizations",
  "Treatments", "Statistical properties",
  "Outcomes", "Hypothetical/rare scenarios",
  "Contexts", "Delineate existing generalizations"
)
