Mechanisms of control:

1. **Violent:** Threats, direct violence, extortion
2. **Nonviolent:** Jobs, payment of bills, basic goods provision

## Our theory

![](crim_gov/theory.png)


## Research Design
### Case selection: Montevideo, Uruguay

- Low violence and crime
- Extensive social protection
- **Crucial least likely case**

## Research Design {visibility="uncounted"}
### Fieldwork (2021-2022)

- 66 in depth interviews
- Review of press and documents (2012-2022)
- **Criminal governance is a sensitive topic**
- **Affected populations are hidden**

## Research Design {visibility="uncounted"}
### Online survey (2022)

- **Estimate prevalence of criminal governance actions**
- N = 2,688
- Direct questions
- Network scale-up questions (NSUM)

## Survey: Direct question

**During the last six months, in your neighborhood, have you seen criminal organizations...**

## What else?

::: incremental
- **Survey:** Similar prevalence in low/high income neighborhoods
- **Survey:** Constrained space for criminal governance
- **Interviews:** Limited attempts at social/political control
:::

## Conclusion

### Findings

- Criminal governance is a relevant phenomenon in Montevideo
- But no attempt at social/political control

## Conclusion

### Implications

- Current explanations may be biased towards cases with more aggressive security policy
- Rethink theoretical scope conditions
