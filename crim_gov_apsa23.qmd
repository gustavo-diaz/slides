## Criminal governance {visibility="uncounted"}

Informal tools to **control community behaviors** that involve **political, economic, or social aspects** with the **goal of profiting from illicit markets**.

## What we know so far

::: incremental
- Mix of violent and nonviolent strategies
- Emergence depends on criminal control and competition
- Where the state is absent
- But also alongside the state
:::

. . .


{{< fa arrow-right >}} Mostly from high violence, low state presence countries

## Questions

. . .

**Why** do we observe *criminal governance* mechanisms in contexts of **low violence** and **high state presence**?

. . .

&nbsp;

**How** does *criminal governance* operate in thexe contexts?

## A theory of criminal governance under low violence and high state presence

![](crim_gov/theory.png)


## Research Design
### Case selection: Montevideo, Uruguay

- Low violence and crime
- Extensive social protection
- **Crucial least likely case**

## Research Design {visibility="uncounted"}
### Qualitative fieldwork (2021-2022)

- 76 in depth interviews
- Review of press and documents (2012-2022)
- **Criminal governance is a sensitive topic**

## Research Design {visibility="uncounted"}
### Online survey (2022)

- N = 2,688
- Network scale-up questions (NSUM)
- ~~Double list experiment~~
- **Estimate extent of criminal governance tools**

## Survey: Direct question

**During the last six months, in your neighborhood, have you seen criminal organizations...**

. . .

&nbsp;

::: columns

::: {.column width="48%"}
#### Violent
- Threaten neighbors
- Evict neighbors
:::

::: {.column width="52%"}
#### Nonviolent
- Make donations to neighbors
- Offer jobs to neighbors

## Interviews: Limited to economic mechanisms

. . .

*Politics for them does not exist, they are in the business [of selling drugs]. Politics is the business of other people, they are interested in having economic means quickly, but politics is not their strong suit*

. . .

&nbsp;

*They are not well-organized enough to be involved in other things*

## Conclusion

- Criminal governance can persist under low crime, high state presence
- But no attempt at social/political control

. . .

### Implications

- Current explanations may be biased towards high violence cases
- Rethinking theoretical scope conditions
