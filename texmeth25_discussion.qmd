- O'Brochta and Parikh. "Determining Politicians' Electorally-Relevant Caste Membership"

- Atsusaka and Landsman. "When Does Ranked-Choice Voting Reduce Polarization?"

. . .

Sounds very different

. . .

Both about: _**~~identity~~** matters for **electoral competition**_

. . .

Sounds like studying ***~~identity~~*** is very important

## O'Brochta and Parikh


**Why you should care:**

::: incremental
- Tricky coding because candidates use/ignore caste depending on many contextual factors

- More complicated than your usual classification task
:::


**Things I like:**

::: incremental
- Lots of domain knowledge in every step!

- Dealing with **electorally relevant** [caste] identity

:::

## Questions

::: incremental

- Scaling up while preserving nuance? 

- How many more to code this way to train a model?

- Why not just crowdsource everything? Or something word embedding style?

- How consequential is this for downstream inferential tasks?

- Standards for this kind of multi-layered coding?

- Campaigns = time in office?

:::

## Atsusaka and Landsman

**Why you should care:**

::: incremental
- Unified modeling of voting behavior across electoral systems
- Very concrete ideas about implementing RCV

**Things I like:**

## Atsusaka and Landsman

**Why you should care:**

- Unified modeling of voting behavior across electoral systems
- Very concrete ideas about implementing RCV


**Things I like:**

::: incremental
- Modeling candidates and voters together
- Thinking of computational modeling as Bayesian inference
:::

## Questions

::: incremental

- Why is this about *ethnic* polarization?

- Can we observe/estimate quantities of interest?

- Lab games?

- Model is static but simulation sequential?

- Four papers in one? Which comes first?
